Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the cybersecurity landscape — both as a powerful defense tool and as a weapon in the hands of attackers.

## How AI is Transforming Cybersecurity
- **Threat Detection & Response** – Machine learning models can analyze vast amounts of network traffic to detect anomalies in real-time.
- **Automated Security Operations** – AI-driven SOAR platforms can respond to incidents within seconds, reducing human workload.
- **Predictive Defense** – By identifying attack patterns, AI can forecast and prevent future breaches.

## The Flip Side: AI-Powered Attacks
- **Deepfake Social Engineering** – AI can create realistic voices and videos for phishing scams.
- **Adversarial AI** – Attackers can manipulate models to bypass security systems.
- **Automated Exploitation** – AI can scan and exploit vulnerabilities at unprecedented speed.

## The Road Ahead
Cybersecurity professionals must not only learn to use AI for defense but also anticipate how it might be weaponized.  
A balanced approach — combining **human expertise** with **AI efficiency** — is the key to staying ahead in the evolving cyber threat landscape.
